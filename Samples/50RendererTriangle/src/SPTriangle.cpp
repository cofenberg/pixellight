		// -> First try usually efficient "half" (16 bit floating point) as data type, if this fails fall back to traditional more expensive "float" (32 bit floating point)
		// -> This is just an example. Because the half data type is no primitive C++ data type there's a CPU conversion overhead you may
		//    want to avoid in case it's not worth the effort... like when only drawing a simple triangle... as mentioned, this is just an example.

		// depends on the used renderer implementation.
		m_pVertexBuffer->AddVertexAttribute(VertexBuffer::Color, 0, VertexBuffer::RGBA);

		// Now that we have added all desired vertex attributes, allocate the buffer. We want to have
		// three vertices (for each corner of the triangle) and the usage of the buffer is considered
		// to be static - this means that the content of the vertex buffer isn't changed during runtime.
		// In fact this data CAN be changed at any time, but this isn't that performant and you should
		// avoid this whenever possible!

		if (m_pVertexBuffer->Lock(Lock::WriteOnly)) {
			// Here we request a pointer to the given attribute of a certain vertex to fill it
			// with our data. If possible, you should always use the provided GetData(<VertexID>, <SEMANTIC>, <CHANNEL>)
			// and SetColor() functions to ensure that you put the data at the correct position into the buffer. For
			// instance the color value can have a different size on different renderer implementations! For
			// security we check the pointer given by GetData() for a null pointer, but normally that's not required.
			// -> "m_pVertexBuffer->SetFloat(0, VertexBuffer::Position, 0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f);" is using a comfort function.
			//    It's still possible to access the data in a more direct way to e.g. copy over data within a single
			//    memory copy operation. Here's an example how to access data in a more performant direct way:
			//        float *pfVertex = static_cast<float*>(m_pVertexBuffer->GetData(0, VertexBuffer::Position));
			//        if (pfVertex) {
			//            pfVertex[0] = 0.0f;
			//            pfVertex[1] = 1.0f;
			//            pfVertex[2] = 0.0f;
			//        }

			// Setup vertex 0
			m_pVertexBuffer->SetFloat(0, VertexBuffer::Position, 0, 0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f);
			m_pVertexBuffer->SetColor(0, Color4::Red);

			// Setup vertex 1
			m_pVertexBuffer->SetFloat(1, VertexBuffer::Position, 0, -1.0f, -1.0f, 0.0f);
			m_pVertexBuffer->SetColor(1, Color4::Green);

			// Setup vertex 2
			m_pVertexBuffer->SetFloat(2, VertexBuffer::Position, 0, 1.0f, -1.0f, 0.0f);
			m_pVertexBuffer->SetColor(2, Color4::Blue);

			// Now that we have filled the buffer with our data, unlock it. Locked buffers
			// CANNOT be used for rendering!
			m_pVertexBuffer->Unlock();
