/**
*  @brief
*    Abstract frontend base class
*
*  @remarks
*    This base class provides an abstract frontend API which is used to develop
*    an actual PixelLight frontend class. Concrete wrappers for certain browsers,
*    such as MS Internet Explorer or Mozilla Firefox are used to map the browser
*    specific frontend API to this general base class.
*
*    The focus of this class is on applications with just one window (if there's a window
*    at all, this depends on the used frontend implementation). This focus makes application development
*    somewhat easier because you only have to concentrate our realizing your project and not how it
*    will be presented (in a window with border, without border, just rendering into an image etc.) to
*    the user.
*
*    The PixelLight technology is designed to be as flexible as possible and so, although this
*    class has a clear focus, it can also be used to develop multi-window applications as well.
*
*    Please note that the frontend system is not designed to be a replacement for a decent GUI
*    system. In here, only primitive and commonly used GUI related feature are offered with a
*    limited feature set. For more complex stuff one has to use a real GUI system.
*
*  @note
*    - Do only interact with the frontend when it really makes sense because it's not guaranteed
*      that every frontend implementation provides every feature exposed by this interface
*    - Stuff like window border, window title bar etc. isn't interesting for the frontend, therefore
*      methods like "GetNativeWindowHandle()" or "GetWidth()" return only information relevant for e.g.
*      rendering into the frontend
