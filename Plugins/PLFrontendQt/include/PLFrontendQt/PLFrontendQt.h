*
*  @section intro_sec Introduction
*
*  This is the PLFrontendQt reference. The PLFrontendQt adapter project fulfils multiple purposes.
*
*  There are generic helpers like the static adapter class for mapping Qt strings to PixelLight
*  strings and vice versa. By using those helpers as well as provided data models and so on it's
*  possible to add PixelLight functionality into Qt applications. In other words: Qt is the master,
*  PixelLight is the slave.
*
*  On the other hand this project also supports the other way around were PixelLight is the master
*  and Qt the slave. This is accomplished by adding an "PLCore::FrontendImpl"-implementation using
*  Qt. Internally Qt has the main loop, but due to the frontend approach this is nothing the user
*  has to care about. One is just using PixelLight. When using "PLFrontend::Frontend" as PixelLight
*  frontend, it's possible to access Qt functionality easily to add a GUI. Additionally, there are
*  advanced features like the RTTI dock widgets making it possible to add new dock widgets to the
*  main window in an universal way, even by implementing them in separate plugins.
